# README Generator

## Description
This README generator will allow a web developer to create a simple README file using inquirer through node.js. A user will be prompted to enter information about their project, and then a README file will be generated based off of their input. 

## Testing
I had to re-do the functions in the generateMarkup.js file a few times to actually render the data onto the page, but I eventually got it using the template literal within the license section function. In the future I would like to add more options for license, and the ability to link multiple github accounts for contributors. 

## Video
